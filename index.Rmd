# Diffusion in Materials · Notes from Class {-}

Notes from Prof. Mohammad Islam Lectures

## Syllabus  {-}

The exams is not suppose to find out what we don't know.
- 85% to 90% is going to be concepts we are deeply familiar with,
- 10% to 15% is going to separate the B+ form A- and A,
- 30% of the questions $\rightarrow$ conceptual questions,
- 70% of the questions $\rightarrow$ mathematical questions (derivation/manipulation).

This is a **Graduate Course** which means that we have to go **beyond what is given in the class**.

## Notes for Exam  {-}

$ k_{B}T = 4\,pNnm = 4\times10^{-21} Nm $

$ t^* = \frac{0.2 \times 10^{-9}m}{\sqrt {4 \times 10^{-21}Nm}} \, \frac{18 \times 10^{-3}\frac{kg}{mole}}{6 \times 10^{23}\frac{molecule}{mole}} = 5 \times 10^{-13} \sim 10^{-12} \, s $

## Overall Structure of the Class  {-}

Why do we brush our teeth for 2 minutes?
That is a P&G research that showed that 2 minutes is the time necessary for **Fluorite** to diffuse into the tooth.
The reason is because it is how long it takes for **F** to diffuse about half of thickness of our first layer of the tooth.


**This will be on the Exam... Figure that out!**

### Basic Concepts  {-}

Think about different phases of materials:
- solid
- liquid
- gas/vapor

Jelly is solid, made of a protein network.
We we talk about diffusion, length scale matter.

Visco-elastic fluid — honey?

Start with underlying concepts: **liquid**
Diffusion concept is dependent on the:
- **Fluctuation** of atoms, molecules, etc...

Then extend that to other classes of materials:
- Polymers in solution
- Polymers in other polymers (solvent is other polymers)
- Diffusion of vacancies in a crystal
- Diffusion of impurities in crystal
- Diffusion in amorphous solids

All this different kinds of concepts that come from **Fluctuations** are called **Random Walk** —> **RW**.
We are going to use this concept to extend and adjust for generallize, and adjustments we have to make to apply it for different kinds of materials.

**RW** —> Ficks' Law —> Logic Extension from the **Random Walk**, it depends on the **Random Walk** concepts.
Here is where most of the students start their Diffusion classes.

Finally look at classic materials problems:
- Composition dependence
- Microstructure evolves (the dependence on diffusion for this evolution), primarilly under load
- The connect that with mechanical properties

If we have time:
- Nucleation & Growth
- How to experimentally measure diffusion (how we now measure diffusion)
