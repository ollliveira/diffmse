That is a P&amp;G research that showed that 2 minutes is the time necessary for Fluorite to diffuse into the tooth. The reason is because it is how long it takes for F to diffuse about half of thickness of our first layer of the tooth. This will be on the Exam… Figure that out! Basic Concepts Think about different phases of materials: - solid - liquid - gas/vapor Jelly is solid, made of a protein network. We we talk about diffusion, length scale matter. Visco-elastic fluid — honey? Start with underlying concepts: liquid Diffusion concept is dependent on the: - Fluctuation of atoms, molecules, etc… Then extend that to other classes of materials: - Polymers in solution - Polymers in other polymers (solvent is other polymers) - Diffusion of vacancies in a crystal - Diffusion of impurities in crystal - Diffusion in amorphous solids All this different kinds of concepts that come from Fluctuations are called Random Walk —&gt; RW. We are going to use this concept to extend and adjust for generallize, and adjustments we have to make to apply it for different kinds of materials. RW —&gt; Ficks’ Law —&gt; Logic Extension from the Random Walk, it depends on the Random Walk concepts. Here is where most of the students start their Diffusion classes. Finally look at classic materials problems: - Composition dependence - Microstructure evolves (the dependence on diffusion for this evolution), primarilly under load - The connect that with mechanical properties If we have time: - Nucleation &amp; Growth - How to experimentally measure diffusion (how we now measure diffusion) "],["lecture-1-particle-motion.html", "Chapter1 Lecture 1 · Particle Motion 1.1 Equilibrium Configuration &amp; Energies 1.2 Time Scale for Fluid Response 1.3 For Water 1.4 Modulus 1.5 Motions that are Temporarily Correlated 1.6 Classes of problem we are interested in 1.7 MSD", " Chapter1 Lecture 1 · Particle Motion Diffusion fundamentally relies on the fact that the constituents molecules/atoms are constantly undergoing Fluctuation. If I’m interested in the materials properties, I have to understand the motion of the contituent particles and if there is any kind of correlation in the motion (\\(0^{th}\\) order). What other properties are intimately related to the mechanical properties of the material? - Thermal Properties 1.1 Equilibrium Configuration &amp; Energies Statistical Mechanics Molecular Thermodynamics Diffusion: things are moving… they are not really stationary. The Dynamics/Response of Fluctuation must be connected with this Equilibrium Configuration. Therefore, we need something else. Other point to have in mind is how the mechanical properties behave with and without external forces: External Forces \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Configuration. Langevin Equation: \\(m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -b\\vec{v} + \\vec{f}(t) + External Forces\\) Viscous Drag · Average Property (from average response of solvent - flow): \\(-b\\vec{v}\\) Rapid Fluctuations · Instantaneous Property (collisions with solvent molecules): \\(\\vec{f}(t)\\) External Forces Viscous Drag It is a Friction Coefficient For a sphere: \\(b = 6 \\pi \\eta R\\) \\(\\eta =\\) Viscosity \\([\\eta] = Pa \\, s = \\frac{N}{m^2} \\, s\\) \\([\\eta] = \\frac{dyne}{cm^2} \\, s = Poise\\) Newtonian Fluid · A Simple Liquid \\(\\eta = constant\\) Non-Newtonian Fluid · Colloidal or Polymer Solution \\(\\eta \\neq constant \\rightarrow\\) It will depend on Shear Rate Milk Shampoo 1.2 Time Scale for Fluid Response Assume \\(T &gt;&gt; T_g\\) (Temperature of Glass Transition) \\(t = \\frac{LengthScale}{\\sqrt{\\langle v^2 \\rangle}}\\) \\(LengthScale \\equiv X \\equiv Particle \\, Diameter = 2R\\) 1.3 For Water It is one molecule of water diffusing in a sea of water molecules: \\(t^* = \\frac{DiameterWaterMolecule}{velocity} = \\frac{2Angstrons}{velocity} = \\frac{0.2 \\times 10^{-9}m}{velocity}\\) How do I get the velocity? \\(\\sqrt{\\langle (v^*)^2 \\rangle} = \\frac{k_BT}{m}\\) Here we are trying to find the length scale for a diffusion process, and we can say that at Room Temperature (RT): \\(k_{B}T = 4\\,pNnm = 4\\times10^{-21} Nm \\Rightarrow\\) WE NEED TO REMEMBER THIS FOR EXAM \\(t^* = \\frac{0.2 \\times 10^{-9}m}{\\sqrt {4 \\times 10^{-21}Nm}} \\, \\frac{18 \\times 10^{-3}\\frac{kg}{mole}}{6 \\times 10^{23}\\frac{molecule}{mole}} = 5 \\times 10^{-13} \\sim 10^{-12} \\, s\\) 1.4 Modulus \\(Modulus \\equiv \\frac{energy}{volume}\\) \\(Liquid \\sim k_BT\\) \\(Solid &gt;&gt; k_BT\\) \\(Gas &lt;&lt; k_BT\\) Looking only at the Liquid: \\(Modulus \\sim \\frac{k_BT}{(2R)^3} \\sim \\frac{4\\times 10^{-21}Nm}{(0.2\\times 10^{-9}m)^3} \\sim 5\\times 10^{8} \\frac{N}{m^2} (Pa)\\) It tells us that the viscosity of any fluid should be of the order of (close to the Boiling Point (BP): \\(\\eta \\sim Modulus \\times RelaxationTime = 5 \\times 10^{8} \\frac{N}{m^2} \\, 5\\times 10^{-13}s \\sim 0.3\\times 10^{-3}Pa\\,s\\) Let’s take a step further… How that is going to impact the evolution of motion: Langevin Equation: \\(m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -b\\vec{v} + \\vec{f}(t)\\) \\(\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} \\rightarrow\\) is going to fluctuate because of \\(\\vec{f}\\) \\(\\vec{f}(t) \\rightarrow\\) rapidly fluctuate \\(\\sim 10^{-12}s \\rightarrow\\) due to collisions from many solvent motions \\(\\rightarrow\\) usually uncorrelated. If there is no correlation between \\(\\vec{f}(t)\\) and \\(\\vec{f}(t&#39;)\\) except at the time equals to \\(t&#39;\\): \\(\\langle f(t) \\cdot f(t + t&#39;) \\rangle \\propto \\delta (t&#39;)\\) If I’m interested in an average, then: \\(\\vec{f}(t) \\rightarrow 0\\) \\(m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -b\\vec{v}\\) Solution: \\(v(t) = v(0) \\cdot e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\\) Where \\(v(0)\\) is related to the boundary/initial condition \\(\\tau \\equiv \\frac{m}{b} \\equiv ViscousRelaxationTimescale\\) The only thing we need to worry about is that if there is a correlation in the motion… if there is no correlation in the motion, those fluctuations are going to cancel each other out. 1.5 Motions that are Temporarily Correlated We can now rewrite the Langevin Equation: \\(\\frac{d\\vec{v}(t&#39;)}{dt&#39;} = -\\frac{\\vec{v}(t&#39;)}{\\tau} + \\frac{\\vec{f}(t&#39;)}{m}\\) How can I find the velocity for this kind of equation (solve the differential equation)? Multiply both sides by \\(e^{\\frac{t&#39;}{\\tau}}\\) Integrate \\(\\int_{0}^t dt&#39;\\) Integrate by parts: \\(\\int GdF = GF - \\int FdG\\) If we consider the average velocity due to Fluctuation: \\(\\langle \\vec{v}(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\vec{v}(0) \\rangle e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} + 0\\) (\\(0\\) because \\(\\vec{f}\\) is random) Here is the exercise for the homework: When we measure the fluctuations we only measure the motions that are correlated, otherwise they would cancel each other out and be zero. So, when we are measuring the correlation, we are measuring the Thermal Energy: \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\langle \\vec{v}(t) \\cdot \\vec{v}(0) \\rangle dt = \\frac{6k_BT}{b}\\) \\(\\frac{6k_BT}{b} \\equiv\\) Damping or Dissipation \\(6 \\equiv\\) 3 Dimension \\(b \\equiv\\) Drag A similar situation is a current through resistor: \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\langle I(t) \\cdot I(0) \\rangle dt = \\frac{6k_BT}{R}\\) Diffusion come in for understanding how a given structure evolves as a function of time. 1.6 Classes of problem we are interested in Continuous Matrix: how does the thing evolves as a function of time? The obstacles interfere with the velocity of the diffusion: Friction Viscosity That’s what Langevin equation says: A particle forgets its velocity over a time of \\(\\tau\\). 1.7 MSD What is the Mean Square Displacement due to solvent molecule fluctuation? We start with the Langevin Equation: \\(m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -b\\vec{v} + \\vec{f}(t)\\) From there we can show that the MSD is (here he is giving us what it should look like, and he asks us to derive it in the homework): \\(\\langle \\, r^2(t) - r^2(0) \\, \\rangle = 6k_BT \\frac{\\tau}{m}[t - \\tau(1 - e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}})]\\) Why do we mean by evolving? Phase separation, things are changing… How the properties are changing along this change… Again, he is giving the answer and we will have to derive it: The particle has two types of motion: Balistic Motion: \\(\\langle r^2(t) - r^2(0) \\rangle = \\langle v^2 \\rangle t^2 \\\\\\) We want to do at a time scale that we do not worry about the Balistic Motion Diffusive Motion: \\(\\langle r^2(t) - r^2(0) \\rangle = \\frac{6\\,k_{B}T}{b}t \\\\\\) This is what we are really interested in. It evolves linearly with time. If I’m interested at the Mean Square Displacement and I assume that the initial position is at the origin (zero), then we can simplify this equation to: \\(\\langle r^2(t) \\rangle = \\frac{6\\,k_{B}T}{b}t \\\\\\) OR \\(\\langle r^2(t) \\rangle = 6Dt\\) , where \\(D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{b}\\) Fluctuation: \\(\\langle r^2(t) \\rangle\\) Friction/Dissipation Factor: \\(D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{b}\\) We are using the symbol r to denote we are doing everything in 3 dimensions — 3D. We can also write the same thing in a different way: \\(\\langle \\Delta r^2(t) \\rangle = 2dDt \\\\\\) Where d is the dimensionality of the situation: 1 D: d = 1 2 D: d = 2 3 D: d = 3 Examples: If we have an impurity which is diffusing along a thin film… that should be a 2D problem. If we have an impurity diffusion within a grain boundary… although it is a 3D situation, normally a grain boundary is a 1D movement, so it is a 1D problem. This assignment of dimensionality is a tricky task, and we have to figure out the correct equation to evaluate the motion. So, here we have the three ways to write the same thing: \\(\\langle r^2(t) - r^2(0) \\rangle = \\frac{6\\,k_{B}T}{b}t \\\\\\) \\(\\langle r^2(t) \\rangle = \\frac{6\\,k_{B}T}{b}t \\\\\\) \\(\\langle \\Delta r^2(t) \\rangle = \\frac{6\\,k_{B}T}{b}t \\\\\\) There is a classical expression that come about, which is the Diffusivity of a Sphere: \\(D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{6 \\pi \\eta R} \\\\\\) Which is the Stokes-Einstein Equation. This calculation is being done everywhere we have a kind of coating. Measuring Diffusion using Video Microscopy (paper is on canvas, for homework): \\(R \\sim 0.498 \\mu m \\\\\\) The diameter is about a micron. The plot is MSD vs different time when you are measuring. The answer is gonna be: \\(\\langle \\Delta r^2(\\tau) \\rangle = 2dD\\tau \\\\\\) So that the slope is gonna be \\(\\sim 4D\\), from where we can get the diffusion constant: \\(D = 0.46 \\pm 0.01 \\mu \\frac{m^2}{s} \\\\\\) Dissipation is not a good thing, but without dissipation we cannot have fluctuation. It is the causality relation. If we take out dissipation, the fluctuation will die away. Dissipation is the origin of Fluctuation, however if we have larger dissipation we will have smaller fluctuation. But temperature will always keep things fluctuating. \\(\\frac{6k_{B}T}{b} = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\vec{v}(0) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t) dt \\\\\\) "],["lecture-2-random-walk.html", "Chapter2 Lecture 2 · Random Walk 2.1 Domain Size · Average Distance 2.2 Connecting Random Walk to Diffusion in Crystals", " Chapter2 Lecture 2 · Random Walk The Fluctuation can be understood as the change in the motion using Langevin Equation: $ m = -b + (t) + External Forces $ In 3D, at a reasonably longer time, the object should have a diffusive motion: $ r^2(t) - r^2(0) = t \\ $ OR $ r^2(t) = 6D , t \\ $ - MSD Fluctuation: $ r^2(t) $ - Dissipation: $ D = $ So that this whole thing is called Fluctuation — Dissipation Theorem. They observed that this happens in every system we can look at, and it is also called the Causality Relationship. There are concepts very useful for looking at: - Coating - Thin film formation - Thin film stability - Etc Now we are going to take the concept of Fluctuation and take the next step… let’s suppose now we have metals: - Phase Segregation - Microstructure Evolution - Etc 2.0.1 At Equilibrium If we take Silver (Ag) and Copper (Au) and let them reach equilibrium, what should I get at the very end? They are not very miscible! They will segregate at the end. Silver is denser and therefore will go to the bottom and and cooper will be at the top. The thickness of the layer of each one will be given by density and The Lever Rule —&gt; Phase Separation. After Quenching we don’t get that from any other way than diffusion. 2.1 Domain Size · Average Distance Thermo Prediction &lt; — DIFFUSION — &gt; How phase segregation is happening Thermo: - Classical Thermodynamics (Partial Diferential Equations) - Continuous Diffusion - Molecular Thermodynamics + Statistical Mechanincs (particles) - Single Particle Motion —&gt; Average over a large # of particles: $ , {t} , , {N} , etc $ 2.1.1 1 Atom in a 1D Crystal Let’s look for: - Domain size - Average Separation Say Free Energy $ E(0) $ It starts at origin $ x = 0 $ , and it moves to $ x = x $. Then, what is the energy at $ x = x, E(x) $? If it can diffuse at any position: - All positions have idendical free energy (entropy + enthalpy) - The states are indistinguishable - All states are degenerate of one another - Then all positions have equal probability for having the Atom - All states are equally sampled at equilibrium - This is derived dirrectly from the assumptions of the problem If those are true, why the Atom moves at all? It explores different positions because he wants to maximize entropy. Occupancy Probability vs Position $ t = 0, P(x=0) =1 and P(x ) = 0 $ $ t , P(x) \\ $ What does it happen in between? In a finite time? The kinetics of the problem? Diffusion is only important if I care about the evolution of the system! 2.1.2 Random Walk (RW) The physical concept behind the Random Walk is the Langevin Equation Allow particles to move around among all the equally probable states, via 1D Random Walk (RW): - Particle moves $ +1 , or -1 $ at every time step - $ x _{t } = 0 $, equal probability to move $ +1 , or -1 $ Remember how to do for a random step, maybe for exam… Average Distance Travelled: - If I give enough time, it is always going to come back to where it started: $ x _{t } = 0 $ - Particles can make large displacements (excursions), $ max(x) $ - Average displacement from origin $ $ - $ avg |x| |x| &gt; 0 $ All Possible RW Paths of n Steps: Paths: - $ n = 2 ++, –, +-, -+ $ 4 paths - $ n = 3 +++, ++-, +-+, -++, +–, -+-, –+, — $ 8 paths The pattern is $ N = 2^n $, where: - N is the # of distinct paths - n is the # of distinct step options (# of objects in each configuration) How many n-step paths with displacement of length x? If the Net Distance \\(= +x\\) after n-steps of \\(+1\\) or \\(-1\\): - \\(+1\\) &amp; \\(-1\\) are the step sizes - We need to have a number \\(x\\) of extra \\(+1\\) - It means \\((n-x)\\) steps equally divided between \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) steps - $ +1 $ - $ -1 $ $ n_{+1} = x + = + \\ $ $ n_{-1} = = - \\ $ How many paths have \\(n_{+1}\\) and \\(n_{-1}\\) regardless of order? - \\(n_{+1} \\rightarrow\\) number of steps with step size \\(+1\\) - \\(n_{-1} \\rightarrow\\) number of steps with step size \\(-1\\) - Total is still \\(= n\\) For that we use the Binomial Formula: \\(\\frac{n!}{n_{+1}!n_{-1}!}\\) \\(\\frac{n!}{(\\frac{n}{2}+\\frac{x}{2})!(\\frac{n}{2}-\\frac{x}{2})!}\\) If \\(n=2\\), what are the paths with a displacement equal to zero (\\(x=0\\))? - $n_{+1} = n_{-1} = 1 $ - $ = = 2 +-, -+ , $ Probability of an n-step path of length x: $ P(x) = , / , 2^n \\ $ Which is the paths of length x divided by the total number of paths. There is no science in this, this is pure math. For the homework, we will have to derive that is equal to the Gaussian Distribution or Normal Distribution: $ P(x) = , / , 2^n = e^{} \\ $ We can also write: $ P(x) = e^{} \\ $ - \\(\\langle x \\rangle = 0 \\rightarrow\\) Mean Displacement - \\(\\langle x^2 \\rangle = n \\rightarrow\\) Variance · Mean Square Displacement · MSD - \\(\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{n} \\rightarrow\\) Root MSD · RMSD · Expectation Value We can now say something about distribution of positions after n steps: - \\(x = 0 \\rightarrow\\) is still the most probable - \\(|x| \\neq 0 \\rightarrow\\) is also much more probable, mainly when we go to a finite time For a given \\(\\langle x \\rangle\\) &amp; \\(\\langle x^2 \\rangle \\rightarrow\\) we will have a Gaussian Distribution \\(\\rightarrow\\) Maximum Entropy \\(\\rightarrow\\) It can also have what is called a Local Equilibrium. For a Normal/Gaussian Distribution: - After n steps we expect to find the particle at an absolute distance from origin: - \\(\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{n} \\rightarrow\\) RMS Distance from Origin \\(\\rightarrow\\) Expectation Value from Origin (regardless of sign) The particle does not stay where it starts! - The states are degenerate \\(\\rightarrow\\) it will not stay at the origin. Why does this happen? ENTROPY is driving Fluctuation! 2.1.2.1 Extending the Step Size What if step size is not \\(+1\\) or \\(-1\\) but \\(\\rightarrow +a\\) or \\(-a\\)? If we do a dimension analysis: - $ x^2 (Length)^2 $ - $ n $ Number Of Steps It seems not to be dimensionally consistent — however, we can easily make it to be consistent by writting the follwoing: - $ x^2 = n a^2 $ If we want to write in time (easy to measure): Number of Steps $ = time $ $ = Frequency = $ $ n = t $ Then: - $ x^2 = a^2 t $ 2.1.2.2 What happens if we move to 2D and 3D? How do we add different quantities in probability? \\(\\Rightarrow\\) We multiply! We consider that events are independent in each dimension. $ P(x_1, …, x_n) = P(x) = , / , 2^n = e^{} $ for d = 1 $ P_d(x_1, …, x_d) = e^{-} $ for dimensionality = d \\(n\\) is the number os steps Notice, if we define the vector \\(\\vec{r}\\) as: $ = (x_1, x_2, …, x_n) $ $ || = $ Distance from Origin $ = (x_1, x_2, …, x_n)^ $ Then: $ P_d(r) = e^{-} $ $ r = 0 $ Most Probable Position \\(\\equiv\\) Mean Position/Displacement $ r^2 = n $ MSD $ = na^2 = a^2 t $ $ = $ RMSD ##### Application: how to estimate the size of a polymer chain?

REMEMBER THIS ABOVE FOR CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS IN THE EXAM! Contour Length $ = Na $ Average Size $ = = 0 $ (Random Walk) To get the Polymer Length, we look at the MSD: - $ r^2 = = Na^2 $ - $ = = N^{}a $ A scientist figured out that the polymer conformation is very similar to the spin conformation in magnetic materials. $ P(x,y,z) = P() = (const) , e^{-} , e^{-} , e^{-} $ $ _x (x - x )^2 _x = x^2 $ $ x = y = z = 0 $ $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2 x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = $ Then, the probability of a polymeler chain having the size r is: $ P(r) = (const) , e^{-} e^{}$ Where \\(F(r)\\) is the Free Energy of a polymer chain of size \\(r \\equiv\\) also called the Elasticity of a Polymer Chain.

Detour · Thermodynamics Concept - An event has energy $ E_i $ - $ P(event) e^{-} $ Now let’s bring these concepts together… SUMMARY: 2.2 Connecting Random Walk to Diffusion in Crystals Simple Picture: - Take an Atom or a Molecule - Put it into a Solvent - Those Atoms or Molecules have some Thermal Energy - The Thermal Energy will put the Atom or Molecule to undergo Fluctuation Everything else that we’ve seen comes out of this basic physical concept. If the particle has some velocity $ v $: - $ v^2 = $ - It is moving fast - It is moving constantly, because it has thermal energy - It is random It is driven by the Fluctuation, but the Dissipation is dictating how things are going to move: - $ = $ Then the Displacement is: - $ P() = , e^{-} $ Again: - $ = 0 $ Mean Position - $ r^2 = Na^2 $ MSD ($ r^2 = a^2t $) - $ = = N^{}a $ RMSD IT IS ON THE HOMEWORK!

One solution is to introduce substitutional impurities. 2. Another would be to use isotopes. - Limitation: - Interactions between substitutional impurities (or isotopes) and crystal atoms are often different than crystal atom - crystal atom. - Complication: - Random Walk may not be independent of each other or history \\(\\rightarrow\\) Correlation, which can be small or very large.

Solvent molecules are constrained to some average position created by their neighboring atoms (feature is analogous to close-pack but it is not a close-pack system) Solvent molecules are not close-packed There is free volume $V_{free} $ and $ $ Locally fluctuate It can move if there is a open path for diffusion (if a path opens up) It can move the entire distance in a large Jump (how long the leap path the solvent presents) Atoms may jump one to many steps It has many different step sizes 4.5 Velocity Atoms move along a free path, they need to find a free path. Once it finds the free path: - $ $ velocity in a gas till it his the dead-end (“wall”) So if there is motion in an amorphous solid, it is going to be like Random Walk with some constraints: - Step size - Direction - Frequency - Randomly distributed (probability of finding a free path) 4.6 D \\(D = C R \\langle v \\rangle P(motion)\\) - C: constant - R: step size (it will be a fraction or multiple of a radius) \\(\\propto R\\) radius of the particle - P: probability of finding a free path Let’s say: - $V_p $ particle volume - $V_f $ average free volume per particle The particle volume needs to fit the free volume. Then: \\(P = e^{-\\frac{V_p}{\\langle V_f \\rangle}}\\) \\(D = C R \\langle v \\rangle e^{-\\frac{V_p}{\\langle V_f \\rangle}}\\) We will impose that particles with different sizes all move with the same velocity \\(\\langle v \\rangle\\) - Larger \\(R\\) have larger kinetic energy \\(\\rightarrow\\) Larger Jumps - That’s why larger particles present larger diffusion in amorphous solid KEY CONCEPT: in amorphous system diffusion is not thermally activated \\(\\rightarrow\\) does not depend on temperature - At any time, particles have large enough \\(\\langle v \\rangle\\) (kinetic energy). - If finds a path \\(\\rightarrow\\) particle moves.
